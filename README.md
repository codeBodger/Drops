Version v1.0-alpha1.0

# Installing the App
1. To install the app for yourself, you will first need to create a
[repl.it](https://repl.it) account.  If you allready have one, you can skip this step.
2. Then, go to [this link](https://replit.com/@RowanAckermanSc/Drops-2) and click the blue
`Fork Repl` button on the right side of the screen. This will make a copy of the app in
your account.  You can now run the app anywhere, you just need to log in to your repl.it
account.  

# Running the App
- To run the app, simply hit the green `run` button at the top of the screen.  
- To view the app larger, press the expand/open in new tab button to the right of the mini
URL bar.

# Passwords
## Creating and Resetting a Password
- To create or change your password, type `./pswd.sh` into the "Shell" and press enter;
then type a password when prompted.  
- If you forget your password, you can simply delete `password.hash` and run `./pswd.sh`
again.
## Reasons to Have a Password
- Anyone can run your version/installation of this program.  This means that they could
theoretically delete all of your data.
- A password prevents people from doing this.  
- Because they cannot directly edit or run any of the files, they can't change, delete, or
create a password.
## Using Your Password
- If you have previously set a password, you must type it in before using the app.  If you
don't, you will still be able to use the app, but your data will not be saved.
- You will stay logged in until you press log out in the main menue.  

# Feature Requests, Bug Reports, etc.
- Please request features, report bugs, etc in the
[issues tab](https://github.com/codeBodger/Drops/issues) for the
[associated GitHub repository](https://github.com/codeBodger/Drops) for this program.  You will
need to create a GitHub account to do this.  

# Updates
- To update the app to the latest version, simply type `./update.sh` into the "Shell" and
press enter.
- It is recommended to do this fairly frequently, about once per month.
